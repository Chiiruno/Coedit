### Shortcuts editor

This category exposes all the shortcuts, sorted by category.

![](img/options/shortcuts.png)

Each item is editable.

- <img src="{%include icurl%}other/clean.png" class="tlbric"/>: Deletes the current assignation.
- <img src="{%include icurl%}other/keyboard_pencil.png" class="tlbric"/>: Displays the editor. The shortcut can also be selected in the combo menu.

After an assignation attempt and if the selected combination is already used the new shortcut is not validated and a warning is displayed.
