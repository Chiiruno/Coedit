## Symbol list

This list displays the symbols declared in the D module that has the focus (imports, classes, variables, etc).
The widget is a GUI front-end for one the [_dastworx_](https://github.com/BBasile/Coedit/tree/master/dastworx) feature.

It can be used to quickly find and go to the declaration of a symbol but also as a basic linter since the syntactic errors are displayed (almost immediately if the option _refresh on change_ is checked).

The way the widget refreshes the list can be tweaked in the context menu or in the [options editor](widgets_options_editor).
