### Project inspector

The project inspector is used to

- select the project configuration.
- open sources in an new editor.
- add or remove source if the active project has the [CE format](features_projects).

The toolbar buttons are only activated for CE projects.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBasile/Coedit/master/icons/file/document_delete.png): Removes from the project the source that's selected in the tree.
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBasile/Coedit/master/icons/folder/folder_add.png): Adds a folder of D source to the project from a dialog. The procedure is recursive.
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBasile/Coedit/master/icons/folder/folder_delete.png): Removes from the project the sources files that stand in the same directory as the source selected in the tree.

Note that instead of using the dialogs to add files, it's also possible to drop items from a file explorer.
